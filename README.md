# FreeSTIX/libstix #

This is currently in a proof of concept phase and represents what a JSON STIX based implementation could look like.  I have tried to follow the specification as close as possible.  However, some of the elements that are based around XML constructs do not map very well to JSON. Given this, I have tried to map them as closely as possible. The only major difference is in the field names being camel cased to the JSON standard. This implementation has not yet been ratified by the STIX community and is subject to change in the coming weeks and months. Anyone wishing to help or contribute to this effort please let me know.
