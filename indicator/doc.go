//
// Indicators convey specific Observable patterns combined with contextual
// information intended to represent artifacts and/or behaviors of interest
// within a cyber security context. They consist of one or more Observable
// patterns potentially mapped to a related TTP context and adorned with other
// relevant metadata on things like confidence in the indicatorâ€™s assertion,
// handling restrictions, valid time windows, likely impact, sightings of the
// indicator, structured test mechanisms for detection, related campaigns,
// suggested courses of action, related indicators, the source of the
// Indicator, etc.
